# Oxford 3000 Word List

A simple - relatively - small dictionary of words. I created this due since there was a lack of lists of accessible dictionary lists out there. So I decided to create one to help future developers working with words/dictionaries.

I uploaded two different txt files. One is the basic file with all the words including spaces (Ex: I am). The second one replaces all spaces within the same phrase with the underscore character (Ex: I_am). The second file still contains spaces between words and phrases.
